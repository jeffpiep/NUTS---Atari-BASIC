Atari BASIC 2016 NOMAM 10-liner programming contest entry. Download the ATR file and play on your favorite emulator.

Climb the trees, jump to gather acorns, but beware the blue jays! Earn points by climbing and collecting acorns, which only fall when you are climbing. The acorns are worth more the higher you climb, but there are more blue jays, too. The game is over when you run into a blue jay. Your high-score is recorded so you can try and beat it the next round.

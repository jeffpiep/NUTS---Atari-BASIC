state design ideas

variable to hold horizontal position
	when stick left (or right)
		change state var to move left or move right, set target position, swap sprite

		test state var
			if move left - dec hpos
			else if move right - inc hpos
		keep doing this until target position is achieved and reset state var
		if reset then swap sprite
		
vertical position of birds and nuts
	problem: when strig climb - vscroll the trees OK
	also need to move birds and nuts down the screen
	birds appear at top of screen and scroll down with climbing
	nuts appear at top of screen and fall normally, faster with climbing?

scrolling of sprite onto playfield

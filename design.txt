state design ideas

variable to hold horizontal position
	when stick left (or right)
		change state var to move left or move right, set target position, swap sprite

		test state var
			if move left - dec hpos
			else if move right - inc hpos
		keep doing this until target position is achieved and reset state var
		if reset then swap sprite
		
vertical position of birds and nuts
	problem: when strig climb - vscroll the trees OK
	also need to move birds and nuts down the screen
	birds appear at top of screen and scroll down with climbing
	nuts appear at top of screen and fall normally, faster with climbing?

scrolling of sprite onto playfield
	need top and bottom pointers
	need position counter
	in MOVE ADR(B$),PM+640+BV,10 do the following
		ADR(B$) becomes ADR(B$)+top pointer
		PM+640+BV stays same
		10 becomes top-bottom pointer+2 BECAUSE WE ARE STEPPING BY 2
	NEW DESIGN IDEA: only actively scroll down part of screen then just move sprite memory down the screen
	
	
states
	end of game
	rest
	climb
	jumping left
	jumping right
	got a nut
	hit a bird
	there's a bird
	there's a nut
	
flags or variables
	nut state, hpos, vpos
	bird0 states, hpos, vpos
	bird1 states, hpos, vpos
	player hpos, tree (sprite mirror)
	score, time
